The hardware reference platform for FLOPSYNC is composed of the following:
-stm32vldiscovery: one per node
-nrf24l01+ based radio module, found on ebay: one per node
-ft232 based usb to serial converter, found on rs: one per node

-optionally an arduino for automated firmware upgrade through ssh
 and event generation for event timestamping experiments

 
GPIO mapping stm32vldiscovery to nRF24L01+
------------------------------------------
1 GND connect to GND on stm32vldiscovery
2 VCC connect to +3.3V on stm32vldiscovery
3 CE    PA1
4 CS    PA2
5 SCK   PA5
6 MOSI  PA7
7 MISO  PA6
8 IRQ   PB0

GPIO mapping stm32vldiscovery to ft232
--------------------------------------
PA9 and PA10 connected to a serial port 19200 8N1

GPIO mapping stm32vldiscovery to arduino
----------------------------------------
connect arduino GPIOs as described in
deploy/fwupgrade/arduino/firmwareupgrade2/firmwareupgrade2.ino
6 arduino GPIOs connect to the reset and boot0 pins of the stm32vldiscovery
so as to be able to put them in serial port bootloader mode, to use
the automated deploy infrastructure found in the deploy folder.

also, digital I/O 8 of the arduino has to be connected to PB1 GPIOs of all
the stm32vldiscovery. This is the event input used for timestamp tests.
