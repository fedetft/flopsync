/**
 * \file arch_registers.h
 * This file should contain the list of hardware registers of the selected
 * architecture, to allow application to directly access the hardware.
 *
 * The list of these registers is usually provided by the chip vendor in the
 * form of one or more header files.
 *
 * To include these registers in a portable way, here we only include
 * arch_registers_impl.h, which will be an header file in
 * arch/arch name/board name/interfaces_impl
 *
 * The usual implementation of arch_registers_impl.h is simply to include
 * the header files provided by the chip vendor.
