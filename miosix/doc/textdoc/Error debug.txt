When the Miosix kernel encounters an ARM data abort, or undefined instruction
interrupt, it prints the address of the instructon that caused the error and
reboots the system.
This can be caused by a stack overflow, or dangling reference.
To convert this address into the name of the function that caused the error, and
the exact code line where the program stopped, use this command:

arm-miosix-eabi-addr2line <ADDRESS> -e main.elf -f | arm-miosix-eabi-c++filt

Example:

arm-miosix-eabi-addr2line 0x0000d494 -e main.elf -f | arm-miosix-eabi-c++filt 
miosix::Timer::interval() const
miosix/kernel/sync.cpp:174

This says that the function is Timer::interval() in file sync.cpp and that the
program stopped at line 174

Please note that for this operation to be reliablle compiler optimization must
be turned off (using -O0 instead of -Os) at least for the file that caused the
error.
