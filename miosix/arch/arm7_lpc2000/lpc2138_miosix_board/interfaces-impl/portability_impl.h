 * Enable interrupts (both irq and fiq)<br>

 * The main advantage of FIQ is that they can even interrupt IRQ, so they have
 * a so high priority that can interrupt the kernel itself.<br>The disadvantage
 * is that, since can interrupt the kernel at any time, all functions, including
 * those marked as IRQ cannot be called when IRQ and FIQ are disabled.
 * Therefore, data transfer between user code and FIQ is more difficult to
 * implement than IRQ. Another disadvantage is that they are only available in
 * the ARM cpu, so if the kernel will be ported to another cpu, they won't be
 * available.<br>
 * To use FIQ the user must change the code of the default FIQ interrupt routine
 * defined in miosix/drivers/interrupts.cpp<br>By default FIQ are enabled but no
 * peripheral is associated with FIQ, so no FIQ interrupts will occur.
