Note: this is no longer a TODO, since essentially everything has been done as
of Miosix 1.58. Only kept for historic reasons.

Thread safety issues:
This is a (probably incomplete) list of parts of newlib that require
locks or atomic ops for thread safety.

- malloc, but newlib already provides __malloc_lock() and __malloc_unlock()
  that take care of this issue.
  FIXED

- newlib/libc/stdlib/__atexit.c
  FIXED

- newlib stdio library, seems to require locks here and there for files.
  It also looks there's a mutex in every FILE struct.
  FIXED
