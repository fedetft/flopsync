Rationale for svc.patch
-----------------------
 
Binutils 2.21.51 fail to accept the "svc" instruction on cortex-m3.
http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12296
This instruction is ofcourse required by Miosix.

Note: this is a temporary patch. It is expected that in the new
binutils release this issue will be fixed upstream.
