# This script allows to replicate the content of the Miosix top level directory
# outside of the Miosix git repository, in order to write an application making
# use of Miosix without creating or altering any file in the Miosix git repo.
# This simplifies updating the kernel with git pull and allows to have the
# Miosix git repository as a submodule of another git repository.
#
# To use this script, open a shell in the directory where you want the
# project to be created and run
# perl <path to the kernel>/miosix/_tools/init_project_out_of_source_tree.pl
